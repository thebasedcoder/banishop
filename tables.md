1. Displaying Order Details üßæ
This is the most fundamental use case. When a customer views their order history, you query the OrderItem table to list every product they purchased in that specific order, along with the quantity and the price they paid.

Without OrderItem: You would only know the total cost of an order (Order table) and which products you sell (Product table), but you couldn't connect them to show what was actually in a specific order.

2. Inventory Management üì¶
The OrderItem table is crucial for tracking your stock levels accurately.

Order Placed: When a new order is created, you look at each OrderItem and its quantity to decrease the stock count for each corresponding Product.

Order Returned: If a customer returns an item, you use the OrderItem record to know exactly which Product and what quantity to add back into your inventory.

3. Business Analytics and Reporting üìà
This is where the OrderItem table becomes a goldmine for business intelligence.

Best-Selling Products: You can easily find your most popular items by counting how many times each productId appears in the OrderItem table.

Customer Purchase History: To see what a specific customer buys most often, you can find all their orders and then list all the associated OrderItems.

Revenue Reporting: To calculate historical sales for a product, you sum the price and quantity from OrderItems. This is vital because the product's current price in the Product table might have changed.

4. Customer-Facing Features ‚≠ê
Many popular e-commerce features are powered by this table.

"Re-order" Button: When a customer clicks "re-order" on a past purchase, you simply grab all the OrderItems from that old order and add them to a new cart.

"Customers Also Bought...": By analyzing the OrderItem table, you can find which productIds frequently appear together in the same orders, allowing you to create powerful product recommendations.
